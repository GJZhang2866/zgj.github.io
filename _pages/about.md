<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am pursuing my PhD degree (2022~) at [Shanxi University](https://www.sxu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Hu Zhang](https://cs.sxu.edu.cn/faculty/professor/3367/index.htm). Before that, I received a B.S. degree from Shanxi University in 2020, majoring in computer science and technology. 

My research interests include Information Extraction, Knowledge Graphs and Language Models.
I have published some academic papers at the top international conference ACL, ICONLP, IJCNN, Journal of Peking University and Journal of Chinese Information Processing
. Additionally, I participated in natural language processing evaluations related to MRC and won the national seconde prize(CAIL 2021) and  the national third prize(CAIL 2020).
